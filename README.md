Title: Entropy of Ordinal Inputs in A Social Data Science Context:  Ontic and Statistical Options
By Wendy Olsen & Ziyang Zhou

We provided a rapid-fire talk at the Royal Statistical Society on 4 Sept, 2024.  

The files include: --One set of Powerpoint slides -- one code file in R script format.

We are ready to take your questions via email.

In all, this set of materials might take up to an hour to read through at a rapid or superficial level. 
BEGINNERS' NOTE: For those without any programming background...a separate github helps you with the Likert scale attitudes questions in India.  This is the one related to our Work, Employment and Society journal article.  See https://github.com/WendyOlsen/normslabourindia - Wendy Olsen

Note:USE R-STUDIO. Try running R and open the script file.  It's an RMD file. You can just run each chunk with the green triangle. Update all your software.  Once that's done, it will run fine.
